# Latin Squares

**This project was completed in response to the work of William C. Arlinghaus, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Lawrence Technological University, "Block Designs and Latin Squares," an invited chapter in John G. Michaels and Kenneth H. Rosen, Applications of Discrete Mathematics, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991, p. 174-186**

This program:
1) Checks whether two Latin Squares are mutually orthogonal
2) Generates values for *r* and *Î»* based on user-entered values for *b*, *v*, and *k*
3) Determines whether set is Balance Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)

## PowerShell Troubleshooting

`Suggestion [3,General]: The command ltnsqr was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: ".\ltnsqr". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.`
